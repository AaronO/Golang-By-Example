# Basics of Go

This chapter covers the basics of Go such as writing a basic **hello world**, declaring **variables**, writing custom **functions**, **types** and **structures**.

This is useful for readers that already have a working knowledge of programming, but simply need to see how those concepts translate into Go and what their syntax is.
